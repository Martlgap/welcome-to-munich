## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer
- A GitHub account (for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of this page

2. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/welcome-to-munich.git
   cd welcome-to-munich
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the website

## ‚öôÔ∏è Special Vite Configuration

This project has a special Vite configuration that handles different base URLs for development and production:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig(({ command }) => {
  var config = {
    plugins: [react()],
    base: "/",  // For local development
  };

  if (command !== "serve") {
    config.base = "/welcome-to-munich/";  // For GitHub Pages just the repo name
  }
  return config;
});
```

### Why This Configuration?

- **Development**: Uses `base: "/"` so you can access the site at `http://localhost:5173`
- **Production**: Uses `base: "/welcome-to-munich/"` to match the GitHub Pages URL structure

### Customizing for Your Repository

If you fork this repository, you'll need to update the production base URL:

1. Open `vite.config.js`
2. Change the base URL to match your GitHub Pages URL:
   ```javascript
   config.base = "/welcome-to-munich/";  // For github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/welcome-to-munich
   ```

## üìù Making Content Changes

### Updating Text Content

Most content is located in `src/App.jsx`. Here's how to make common changes:

1. **Update the main title**:
   ```jsx
   <h1>üá©üá™ Welcome to Munich!</h1>
   <p>DDAD CI TEAMS Workshop 2025 Guide</p>
   ```

2. **Add/modify sections**: Look for the `sections` object and the content rendering logic

3. **Update emergency numbers**: Find the emergency section and update the contact information

4. **Modify restaurant recommendations**: Locate the food section and update the listings

### Changing Images

1. **Workshop logo**: Replace `public/workshop-logo.png` with your own image (keep the same name)
2. **Favicon**: Replace `public/vite.svg` with your own icon

### Styling Changes

- **Main styles**: Edit `src/App.css` for layout and visual changes
- **Global styles**: Edit `src/index.css` for site-wide styling
